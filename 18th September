Sum of Query II 
Medium Accuracy: 82.91% Submissions: 3587 Points: 4
You are given an array arr[] of n integers and q queries in an array queries[] of length 2*q containing l, r pair for all q queries. You need to compute the following sum over q queries.

 

Array is 1-Indexed.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
arr = {1, 2, 3, 4}
q = 2
queries = {1, 4, 2, 3}
Output: 10 5
Explaination: In the first query we need sum 
from 1 to 4 which is 1+2+3+4 = 10. In the 
second query we need sum from 2 to 3 which is 
2 + 3 = 5.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function querySum() which takes n, arr, q and queries as input parameters and returns the answer for all the queries.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n+q)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n, q ≤ 1000
1 ≤ arri ≤ 106
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n

CODE:
class Solution:
    def querySum(self, n, arr, q, queries):
        l=[]
        for i in range(0,len(queries),2):
            k1 = queries[i]
            k2 = queries[i+1]
            s=0
            for j in range(k1-1,k2):
                s+= arr[j]
            l.append(s)
        return l
